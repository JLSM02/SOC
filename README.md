This repository aims to be a portfolio of my work during my Bachelor's Final Project in the Physics Degree.

  -The .f90 file is a Fortran file, containig some subroutines which are the same physic simulation with different properties.
    ·standardsimulation: only stores data for size and time, it always use open boundary conditions.
    ·completesimulation: can adjust boundary conditions, stores all the variables
    ·genanimdata: to be used with animationmaker.py
  -The .pynb files are data analysis of physic simulations.
